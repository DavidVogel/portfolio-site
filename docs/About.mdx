Hello and welcome to my portfolio site!

I am a **technical writer**, **software engineer**, and **musician** with a diverse background that includes computer science, classical piano performance and teaching, music composition, and mechanical design. I am passionate about my work, with a keen interest in educating users—whether they are laypeople or experts.

I created this site to showcase some of my personal projects, since almost all of my professional work has been for internal corporate use.

You can see my education and work history on <a href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmichaelvogel/"} target={"_blank"}>LinkedIn</a>—feel free to connect with me!

I also have some music (currently, only [12 pieces for piano](/docs/My-Pieces/Twelve)) on various streaming services. You can find links to those on my Linktree <a href={"https://linktr.ee/davidmvogel"} target={"_blank"}>here</a>.

## About the work here

I have a lot of content in the works, but currently my main focus is on documenting the Vital software synthesizer:

* Vital synthesizer documentation
  * [Overview](/docs/Vital/Overview)
  * [User Guide](/docs/Vital/UserGuide/Intro)
  * [Code Docs](/docs/Vital/Vital-Code-Docs)
