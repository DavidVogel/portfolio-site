# Vital Code Repository Docs

:::info
The code docs are a work in progress. I spent a hefty amount of time generating Doxygen comments for the repo using ChatGPT (o1 model) and will update them as I become more familiar with the code base. So, take these with a grain of salt, as they need a lot of review and cleanup.
:::

Docusaurus does not support navigation to static `index.html` files smoothly. Therefore, I have provided two ways to view them: in the `iframe` browser below, or leaving the main navigation and <a href={"/Vital/doxygen/docs/html/index.html"} target={"_blank"}>going to them directly</a>.

You can find the repo for this project is at https://github.com/DavidVogel/VitalHelp.
