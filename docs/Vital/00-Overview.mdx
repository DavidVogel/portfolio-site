# Overview of My Vital Documentation

[Vital](https://github.com/mtytel/vital) is a powerful, open-source spectral warping wavetable synthesizer created by Matt Tytel. However, it appears that no official documentation was providedâ€”either for end users or developers.

## [User Guide](/docs/Vital/UserGuide/Intro)

During my research, I found two existing user guides:

* [Vital community documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G9C2zbuTkn28EgsoiuuuDEflfRD16i_A5XiQi9lnGuk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5d1l3hngcm36)
* [Vital User Manual](https://hooklineismyhomie.weebly.com/vital-user-manual.html) by Zachary Hill.

While these are commendable efforts, I believe there is much more to explore and expand upon. Therefore, I am creating [my own user guide](/docs/Vital/UserGuide/Intro). As time permits, I plan to add tutorials and examples to help users maximize their experience with Vital.

## [Code Documentation](/docs/Vital/Vital-Code-Docs)

The [Vital code repository](https://github.com/mtytel/vital) contains very few comments, so I have taken the initiative to add [Doxygen comments](/docs/Vital/Vital-Code-Docs). To kickstart the process, I initially used ChatGPT (o1 model) to generate comments, allowing me to quickly grasp the structure of the codebase and proceed with writing the user guide. As I continue exploring the code, I will be reviewing and refining these comments for accuracy and clarity.

I am also creating a chatbot trained on my user guide. I haven't set this up in production yet because I need to finish the user guide first. */}

## Other resources

There are numerous tutorial videos available online, though their quality and depth vary significantly. A simple search should help you find a range of content.
