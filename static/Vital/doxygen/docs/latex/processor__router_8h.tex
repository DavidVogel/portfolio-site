\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declares the Processor\+Router class, which manages a graph of Processors and their dependencies. 

The Processor\+Router is responsible for coordinating multiple Processors in a signal processing chain. It manages the order in which Processors run (topological sorting), ensures that feedback loops are handled via Feedback objects, and handles both polyphonic and monophonic processing paths.

By nesting Processor\+Routers, complex signal routing and modular arrangements of Processors can be built.
